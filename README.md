# Roblox-3D-Engine
A satisfactory 3D Engine that works for roblox.

## Features
- Object File loading
- Textures
- View Plane Clipping
- Z Depth Buffer
- Support for CFrame Matrices
- Model functions like moving, rotating and sizing
- And much more!

## How To Use
Just require the key modules like the Engine3D module, Camera modules, and ModelLoader module.
Make sure to use this on the client because that is what it is designed for.
> Note: This engine is not perfect, it still needs to be optimized more.

## Other Information
To draw to the screen on Roblox, my engine uses the [CanvasDraw] module. I do not own this module, and it is only as optimized as the creator made it to be.
I will also be updating this repository to fix other bugs or use other methods.
